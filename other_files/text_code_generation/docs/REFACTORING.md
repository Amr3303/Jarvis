# Jarvis AI Assistant Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring effort for the Jarvis AI Assistant's generative AI module, focusing on consolidating duplicated functionality while maintaining clean code practices and object-oriented programming principles.

## Refactoring Overview

The refactoring process focused on the following key areas:

1. **Code Consolidation**: Merging functionality from multiple files into comprehensive, well-organized modules
2. **Import Structure**: Fixing import issues and providing robust fallback mechanisms
3. **Compatibility**: Ensuring the code works across different environments (Paperspace, local machines)
4. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling with robust fallbacks and clear error messages

## Consolidated Modules

### 1. `evaluation_metrics.py`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive framework for evaluating generative AI outputs.

**Consolidated from**:

- `evaluate_model.py`
- `evaluation.py`
- `consolidated_evaluation.py`

**Key Features**:

- BERTScore implementation with support for models like DeBERTa for semantic similarity evaluation
- Enhanced ROUGE/BLEU score computation for text generation evaluation
- Robust perplexity calculation for language model quality assessment
- Hallucination detection capabilities
- Human feedback collection framework
- Comprehensive reporting and visualization tools

**Improvements**:

- Single entry point for all evaluation needs
- Comprehensive metrics for different types of text generation tasks
- Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are not available
- Better visualization and reporting capabilities

### 2. `nlp_utils.py`

**Purpose**: Centralized natural language processing utilities.

**Key Features**:

- Safe initialization of spaCy with appropriate fallbacks
- Minimal tokenizer implementation for environments where spaCy has compatibility issues
- Comprehensive text processing utilities with graceful degradation
- Compatibility solutions specifically for Paperspace environments

**Improvements**:

- Eliminates spaCy-related crashes in Paperspace environments
- Provides consistent text processing across different environments
- Centralizes NLP functionality that was previously scattered across multiple files
- Better error handling and logging for NLP operations

### 3. `import_utilities.py`

**Purpose**: Resolve import problems throughout the codebase.

**Key Features**:

- Path fixing to ensure modules can be found
- Monkey patching for missing modules
- Import verification tools
- Functions to dynamically fix import blocks
- Standalone implementations of critical functions

**Improvements**:

- Single module for handling all import-related issues
- No more circular import problems
- Robust fallbacks for missing dependencies
- Support for dynamic path fixing in different environments

### 4. `deepseek_handler.py`

**Purpose**: Unified interface for DeepSeek model operations.

**Key Features**:

- Fine-tuning capabilities with Unsloth optimization
- Storage optimization for different environments
- Google Drive integration for model persistence
- Helper functions for working with DeepSeek models in Paperspace

**Improvements**:

- Consolidated all DeepSeek-related functionality into a single module
- Optimized for different hardware configurations
- Better storage management for large models
- Support for quantization and other optimization techniques

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility through:

- Function signatures that match the original implementations
- Re-exporting of key functions at their original import locations
- Import fixes that automatically redirect to the new consolidated modules

### Error Handling

Error handling has been significantly improved with:

- Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are not available
- Clear error messages with suggested solutions
- Automatic fallbacks to simpler implementations
- Comprehensive logging throughout the codebase

### Environment Compatibility

The code now works seamlessly across different environments:

- **Local Development**: Full functionality with all dependencies
- **Paperspace**: Special handling for spaCy compatibility issues and storage optimization
- **CPU-only**: Fallbacks for when GPUs are not available
- **Google Colab**: Support for Google Drive integration and session persistence

## How to Use

### Evaluation

```python
from src.generative_ai_module.evaluation_metrics import EvaluationMetrics

# Initialize metrics
metrics = EvaluationMetrics(use_gpu=False)

# Evaluate generated text
results = metrics.evaluate_generation(
    prompt="Write a function to calculate fibonacci numbers",
    generated_text="def fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
    reference_text="def fib(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a",
    dataset_name="coding_examples",
    save_results=True
)
```

### NLP Utilities

```python
from src.generative_ai_module.nlp_utils import tokenize_text, process_text_with_spacy_or_fallback

# Simple tokenization
tokens = tokenize_text("This is a test sentence.")

# More comprehensive processing
result = process_text_with_spacy_or_fallback("Jarvis is an AI assistant that helps with coding tasks.")
print(result["tokens"])
print(result["sentences"])
```

### Import Fixing

```python
from src.generative_ai_module.import_utilities import fix_imports, check_imports

# Check if imports are working
import_status = check_imports()
print(import_status)

# Fix imports in a specific file
fix_imports("path/to/problematic/file.py")
```

### DeepSeek Model Handling

```python
from src.generative_ai_module.deepseek_handler import DeepSeekHandler

# Initialize handler
handler = DeepSeekHandler(
    model_name="deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base",
    use_unsloth=True,
    load_in_4bit=True
)

# Generate code
code = handler.generate_code(
    prompt="Write a Python function to find the largest element in a list",
    max_new_tokens=512
)
print(code)
```

## Testing

The refactored modules can be tested using the provided `test_refactored_modules.py` script, which verifies that all consolidated modules work correctly in a basic capacity without requiring GPU resources.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

- More extensive unit tests for each module
- Additional documentation and examples
- Performance optimizations for large-scale evaluations
- Integration with more model architectures beyond DeepSeek
