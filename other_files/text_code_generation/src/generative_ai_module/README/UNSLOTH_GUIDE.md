# Unsloth for DeepSeek Optimization

This guide explains how Unsloth is used to optimize DeepSeek-Coder fine-tuning in the Jarvis AI Assistant.

## What is Unsloth?

[Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) is an optimization library that makes fine-tuning large language models:

- 2x faster training
- Up to 80% less memory usage
- Support for much longer context lengths
- Compatible with different hardware (CUDA, MPS, CPU)

## How to Use

### Command Line Usage

When using the fine-tuning script from the command line, Unsloth optimization is automatically applied:

```bash
python src/generative_ai_module/run_finetune.py
```

Important flags to customize your fine-tuning:

```bash
# For NVIDIA GPUs, 4-bit quantization is used by default
# For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), 8-bit quantization is used automatically

# Specify custom sequence length (possible with Unsloth memory savings)
python src/generative_ai_module/run_finetune.py --sequence-length 4096

# Customize batch size
python src/generative_ai_module/run_finetune.py --batch-size 16

# Use a specific language subset
python src/generative_ai_module/run_finetune.py --subset java --all-subsets False
```

### Interactive Mode

When running without arguments, the script will use Unsloth optimization with hardware-appropriate defaults:

```bash
python src/generative_ai_module/run_finetune.py
```

You'll be prompted about whether to train both DeepSeek and text models:

```bash
Do you want to train both DeepSeek code model and text models? (y/n):
```

## Using in Jupyter Notebooks and Kaggle

We provide ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks for training with Unsloth:

1. **Standard Notebook**: `notebooks/unsloth_deepseek_demo.ipynb`
2. **Kaggle-specific**: `kaggle_deepseek_unsloth.ipynb` (optimized for Kaggle environments)

### Setting up in Kaggle

On Kaggle, make sure to install the required packages at the beginning of your notebook:

```python
# Kaggle-specific setup
!pip install -q unsloth unsloth_zoo
!pip install -q transformers peft trl accelerate bitsandbytes

# Fix CUDA library linking (common issue in Kaggle)
!ldconfig /usr/lib64-nvidia 2>/dev/null || echo "Run with sudo if needed"
```

## Benefits

### 1. Memory Efficiency

Unsloth uses optimized kernels and quantization techniques to reduce memory usage:

- **NVIDIA GPUs**: Can fit models up to 70% larger than standard methods
- **Apple Silicon**: Can train larger models on M1/M2/M3 Macs
- **CPU**: Even enables training on CPU when GPU is unavailable

### 2. Faster Training

Unsloth provides significant speedups:

- Up to 2x faster training on most hardware
- More efficient gradient computation
- Optimized LoRA implementation

### 3. Longer Context

Unsloth enables working with significantly longer sequences:

- Standard fine-tuning might be limited to 512-1024 tokens
- With Unsloth, you can potentially use 2048, 4096, or even longer sequences

### 4. Better Quality Models

Unsloth's optimizations often result in better models:

- More stable training with specialized optimizations
- Ability to use larger batch sizes leads to better convergence
- Support for longer context windows improves understanding of complex code

## Architecture Support

The current implementation supports:

- DeepSeek-Coder models (6.7B, 1.3B, etc.)
- QLoRA fine-tuning with 4-bit and 8-bit quantization
- Hardware detection for NVIDIA GPUs, Apple Silicon, and CPU
- Automatic handling of test, validation and training splits

## Implementation Details

Unsloth is now the default optimization method used through these components:

1. `unsloth_deepseek.py` - Core implementation with improved error handling and dataset preparation
2. `run_finetune.py` - Entry point with hardware-specific optimizations
3. `code_preprocessing.py` - Enhanced dataset preparation with proper train/validation/test splits

## Dataset Handling Improvements

The implementation includes robust dataset handling:

1. **Proper Splitting**: Data is split into train, validation, and test sets consistently
2. **Data Cleaning**: Empty or malformed examples are automatically removed
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of errors during training
4. **Format Conversion**: Automatically converts tokenized data for Unsloth compatibility

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Missing Libraries

If you see errors about missing libraries:

```bash
ImportError: Unsloth: Please install unsloth_zoo via `pip install unsloth_zoo`
```

Run our setup script which installs all required dependencies:

```bash
bash setup_unsloth.sh
```

### CUDA Library Issues

On some environments (particularly Kaggle), you might see:

```bash
Unsloth: CUDA is not linked properly.
```

Fix this with:

```bash
sudo ldconfig /usr/lib64-nvidia  # On Kaggle/Colab
```

Or for custom CUDA installations:

```bash
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/cuda-XX.X/lib64  # Replace XX.X with your CUDA version
```

### Import Order

Always import `unsloth` first:

```python
import unsloth  # Import this first!
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Then import other libraries
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# ...
```

### Out-of-Memory Errors

If you encounter OOM errors:

1. **Reduce batch size**: `--batch-size 2`
2. **Try 4-bit quantization**: `--load-in-4bit`
3. **Shorter sequences**: `--sequence-length 1024`
4. **Fewer samples**: `--max-samples 1000`
5. **Use gradient accumulation**: This happens automatically but can be adjusted

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, you can directly use the Unsloth APIs:

```python
from src.generative_ai_module.unsloth_deepseek import get_unsloth_model, finetune_with_unsloth

# Load optimized model
model, tokenizer = get_unsloth_model(
    model_name="deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    load_in_4bit=True
)

# Custom fine-tuning
finetune_with_unsloth(
    train_dataset=your_dataset,
    eval_dataset=your_eval_dataset,
    max_steps=100,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4
)
```

## Hardware-Specific Optimizations

The system automatically applies hardware-specific optimizations:

1. **NVIDIA GPUs**: Uses 4-bit quantization, larger batch sizes, longer sequences
2. **Apple Silicon**: Uses 8-bit quantization, smaller batch sizes, reduced samples
3. **CPU**: Falls back to 8-bit with minimal batch sizes for compatibility

## Example Performance Metrics

Here are some example performance metrics from our testing:
