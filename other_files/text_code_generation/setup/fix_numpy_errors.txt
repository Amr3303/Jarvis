Python version: 3.11.5 (main, May  3 2025, 21:42:01) [GCC 11.4.0]
NumPy version: 2.1.2
❌ NumPy 2.x detected

A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.1.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

Unsloth: Patching Xformers to fix some performance issues.
❌ unsloth error: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
====================================================================
Fix complete! Your environment should now have:
- NumPy 1.26.4 (compatible with all ML libraries)
- PyTorch 2.1.2 with CUDA 12.1
- Transformers 4.36.2, PEFT 0.6.0, Accelerate 0.27.0
- Unsloth 2025.3.3 (compatible with this setup)

This should resolve all compatibility issues for Paperspace RTX5000.
